# Object_Detection
Real Time Object Detection using OpenCV

### Requirements:
- Python >= 3.5
- OpenCV >= 4.2 (For Darknet Support on Yolov4)
- Numpy

OpenCV doesn't utilize GPU if it isn't installed with GPU binaries. 
So for using OpenCV with GPU we have to build it from source using CMake and Visual Studio.
